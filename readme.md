# This is the TV Prototype for the 11th September

The index file now won't work. But the other pages single-series.html, multi-ep.html and multi-series.html should now work.

To make changes to any of the content, just edit the respective json files in the ```_data``` folder.

The website is published via GitHub pages so any new commits should be reflected quickly.

I made the button presses and the animations work using jQuery/CSS. It got super hacky! Apologises in advance if anyone is asked to change these.
