# This is the TV Prototype for the 11th September

The index file now won't work. But the other pages single-series.html, multi-ep.html and multi-series.html should now work.

To make changes to any of the content, just edit the respective .json files in the ```_data``` folder.

The website is published via GitHub pages so any new commits should be reflected quickly.

I made the button presses and the animations work using jQuery/CSS. It got super hacky! Apologies in advance if anyone is asked to change these.

If you REALLY want to run the prototype locally you'll need to install jekyll. I'd follow the steps on the official Jekyll website. You'll need an up to date version of ruby and then install Bundler and Jekyll.
