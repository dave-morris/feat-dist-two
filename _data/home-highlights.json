Robert Mugabe, the eviction of the white farmers and a general aura of danger have combined to make Zimbabwe a no-go zone in the eyes of the world. Now, with Mugabe finally gone, Rom is travelling around the country to find out if Brits should be holidaying here once more.\n\nRom is met by Chipo, a teacher who was born and raised in Harare under Mugabe’s rule. She explains that although people have been coming to the country, few venture beyond Victoria Falls. She wants to show Rom what they are missing on a grand, epic road trip that takes in stunning National Parks and close-up encounters with rhinos, elephants and the ‘cheetah ambassador’. Along the way he gets caught in biblical lightning storms, re-enacts the film Titanic on a Lake Kariba houseboat and tries the home-brewed beer he made in a bathtub in Bulawayo. \n\nBut safe as the country feels, Rom is visiting at a time of undeniable turmoil. Mile-long petrol queues form at every station - the fallout of the country’s latest economic crisis. Rom learns about the origins of the conflict - from the denial of black culture in the Rhodesian era to the legacy of Cecil Rhodes - and finds out why this generation of Zimbabweans are so desperate for people to visit.",

He follows the production of cherry bakewells, from the arrival of 27 tonnes of flour right through to dispatch. Along the way, he learns what makes a shortcrust pastry ‘short’ and discovers the simple way they ensure every cherry is precisely placed. They employ a team of 12 who carefully pop each one on top by hand. \n \nMeanwhile, Cherry Healey is learning how to swerve a soggy pastry bottom when baking pies and tarts at home. She discovers that it is all about a pre-heated oven, a proper pie dish, rolling the pastry to the correct thickness and blind baking. And she is at an almond butter factory, learning how almonds are roasted and milled to become a thick spread ready for toast. \n\nHistorian Ruth Goodman is sniffing out the origins of one of the cherry bakewell's key ingredients, frangipane. She learns that, surprisingly, the familiar fragrant almond filling was born out of a perfume used to disguise the foul smells of 17th-century Paris. She also visits the Peak District town of Bakewell and learns how the modern cherry bakewell is a descendent of a simple recipe mistake in the kitchen.",

An urgent response team is immediately despatched but the attackers have made off with £15k of savings hidden under the floorboards in a Quality Street tin. Detective Andy Richardson, a man with an unshakeable belief in right and wrong and an impressive track record of delivering justice, takes on 70-year old Michael’s case and sets his team to work scouring CCTV and gathering witness statements including from known informants. This, Andy tells his team, is a ‘proper job’. “If helping someone is catching a bad guy whose causing harm to give them closure to make them feel safe at home because of what’s happened then I’m going to do something about it. It’s my job to do something about it”. Within hours their first suspect in custody while they’ve seized 236 items of evidence including a machete and masks.\n \n55 miles north of Sunderland in a secluded hamlet where ‘all jokes aside, sheep outnumber people’ Neighbourhood PC Curtis Ritchie is visiting another victim of a theft - horse lover Emma’s much treasured vintage Landrover Defender has been stolen in the dead of night. It turns out it wasn’t the only one stolen that night and Curtis thinks it’s the work of an organised crime gang. \n\nIn Newcastle and Gateshead a young and increasingly organised crime gang are causing havoc – recklessly stealing mopeds and motorbikes with escalating violence and impact on the owners. A new undercover task force is set up to stamp out the problem, they dedicate their evenings to stake outs in the hope of catching them red handed. “You kind of think where is the job going? Why am I sitting here, freezing cold, soaking wet? But I have a responsibility to these victims to make sure I do everything I can.” But a strike comes with risk as Ant informs his team that the latest intelligence is that gang members are not only carrying machetes but also ammonia.  \nAll the crimes featured in the episode were under investigation during the same week.",

    "synopses": {
      "large": "Fred Sirieix is heading to Venice in the company of chef-restaurateur Angela Harnett, whose Italian family heritage has given her a lifelong love of Italian food. Her Michelin-starred restaurant Murano is named after one of the Islands in the Venetian lagoon. \n\nHeading across the lagoon in an elegant water taxi, Fred can’t help but feel the allure and glamour of the city, but to him Venice is a destination better suited to romance than it is to food. However Angela insists that if you know the city as well as she does, you can avoid over-priced tourist traps and find some unforgettable food experiences.\n\nThe first place in her little black book, and her all-time favourite place to eat in Venice, is Osteria Alle Testiere, a tiny restaurant in the south east district of Castello. Alle Testiere was opened 20 years ago by friends Luca de Vita and Bruno Gavangnin and seats just 22 diners in a space of only 35m2. Chef Bruno changes his menu every single day, offering local fish and seafood from the lagoon in the fresh and light style traditional of Venetian cuisine. Fred is delighted by the subtle flavours of Bruno’s food, and the wonderful front of house service provided by Luca. From the tiny pilgrim scallops with mint and lemon with which they start to the house speciality of artichoke and ricotta ravioli served with local langoustine and prawns, every course is simple, delicious and beautifully presented. Fred wants to know how they can create such unforgettable meals in such a tiny kitchen, while Angela wants to understand how Luca and Bruno overcome the challenges that the city itself puts in their way.\n\nThe next morning Fred and Angela are up early to meet Luca and Bruno at Venice’s Rialto fish market, next to the Grand Canal. There is a huge range of produce on offer, but chef Bruno will only buy fish and seafood that has been caught in the lagoon and he is very selective - rejecting anything but the best and freshest. Bruno only decides what is on the menu after he has bought his daily supplies and experimented in the kitchen to work out the perfect way to serve that day’s catch, leaving Luca with just an hour to rewrite the menu before the lunchtime customers arrive.  \n\nAngela also wants Fred to experience Caffè Florian in St Mark’s Square, founded in 1720 and one of the oldest cafes in Europe, a place that has turned table service into an art form. Florian’s ornate interior and terrace with views of the Duomo and the square can house 400 customers at a time. Here Fred and Angela order coffees and treat themselves to ice creams and Florian’s signature semifreddo tiramisu. Angela thinks the desserts are excellent, and although pricey, made from the best ingredients. Add the view of St Mark’s and it is well worth splashing out, but for Fred it is not the food that really stand out, it is the waiters.  \n\nThe impeccably dressed waiters serve every order on a silver tray that is expertly twisted as it is placed on the table so that each drink or pastry lands exactly in front of the person who ordered it. Fred wants to try his hand at this kind of table service and is shocked to discover how heavy the trays are and how incredibly difficult it is to make service look so effortless. Angela is surprised to learn that the historic building that houses the cafe doesn’t contain a kitchen - instead the cakes, pastries and ice-creams are made ten minutes walk away. The completed trays of cakes have to be carried over bridges, through tourist packed streets and across St Mark’s square. It is exhausting and leaves Angela with even greater respect for the dedication of the Florian team.\n\nThe historic centre of Venice measures less than 12 square kilometres and nothing is grown there – so all the food served in every restaurant has to be brought in by boat and then by cart or by hand. Fred joins Thomas, who supplies fresh fruit and vegetables to Alle Testiere on the barge that brings his supplies into the city. It takes four hours to load the barge, reach Venice, unload the barge and transport the fruit and veg boxes to the market stall just outside the restaurant. A huge effort that leaves Fred more impressed than ever that Bruno and Luca never compromise on quality in anything they offer at Alle Testiere. \n\nThe final place that Angela wants Fred to experience is a family run restaurant on the fisherman’s island, Burano. Chef Ruggero took over the Gatto Nero in 1965 and his son Massimiliano is in charge of front of house. Ruggero’s signature dish is a simple risotto, but Angela believes it is the best risotto she has ever tasted. Fred joins Massimiliano on a fishing trip to catch the bony go fish that flavours the stock at the heart of the dish. To Angela, Gatto Nero sums up so much of what she loves about Italian food – a family atmosphere and a complete dedication to traditional ingredients. And, like Alle Testiere and Caffe Florian it is a place that you will never forget.",
