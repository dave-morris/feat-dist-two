"large": "At the heart of the NHS are the nursing staff, who care for one million patients every 24 hours across Great Britain. These unsung heroes are at the frontline of the health service, facing the ever-stretched reality of an unprecedented staffing crisis and patients with more complex needs than ever before. \n\nThis series follows one hospital in Derby which is trialling an innovative social experiment based on a scheme in Germany. Their aim is to find out whether young volunteers can help relieve the pressures of staff on the wards and make a positive difference to patient care. \n\nFourteen 18-24-year-olds have signed up to volunteer at the Royal Derby Hospital for six weeks. None of them have worked on a hospital ward before and some are yet to have a full-time job of any type. They are mentored by senior nurse Karen, who is monitoring their progress and assessing whether the scheme could work long term for the NHS. Karen has been qualified for 32 years and hopes that the new volunteers have the resilience to handle life on the wards. 'Working in the NHS is a constant daily battle. There is not enough staff to care for patients'.\n\nThe volunteers won’t be parachuted into the wards completely unaware. Before they are allowed near patients it is the job of clinical educator Andy to train them. It is a big job and he is feeling the pressure. 'I’m very nervous. They could kill somebody'.\n\nThey have got two weeks in the classroom to learn everything from taking blood pressure readings to using hoists and making beds. Afterwards, they are sent out to six of the hospital's busiest and most demanding wards where they will be faced with the harsh realities of what patient care really means to seriously sick patients. Will they be able to make a difference, carrying out essential healthcare tasks from personal care to patient observations? \n\n21-year-old Deborah and 19-year-old Poppy are sent to the colorectal ward, where they work under the watchful eye of sister June, who knows this isn’t a job for everyone. Patients on this ward are treated for diseases of the stomach and colon, and Deborah’s first task is to assist healthcare assistant Margaret clean a leaking stoma bag. Will she be able to face her fears and provide care, or will she be completely overwhelmed? \n\nSister Crystal also receives two volunteers onto the head and neck ward. Law student Charlotte excels at chatting with patients and assisting with care but Crystal fears for Erik, who has only ever experienced the inside of a private hospital. She worries that Erik could be 'too posh to wash' as he struggles to make tea and carry out personal care. \n\nWill and Fin, both 19 years old, are allocated to the cancer ward, where they are faced with patients in different stages of the disease. It is a tough ward and the staff know that it is a very demanding both emotionally and physically, so when word gets back to sister Nicola that Will feels that the work that they are given isn’t challenging, hospital staff are left feeling that maybe the boys just aren’t trying hard enough. \n\nThe other volunteers settle into wards on the hospital, as clinical educator Andy and senior nurse Karen meet with the chief nurse Cathy. Together they assess the volunteer’s progress and whether this scheme could work for the Royal Derby Hospital. But with concerns already being vocalised throughout the wards, will these volunteers be a more of a hindrance than a help? And with such a mixed cohort of young people, can anyone work in the caring sector, or does it take a certain type of person to handle the blood, sweat and tears of the NHS?",

"large": "It looked like a cold-blooded murder. At midnight outside a convenience store, a white supremacist ran over and killed a young black man in his Jeep, while his girlfriend was heard yelling “Get him baby, get him”. Shortly afterwards, CCTV of the incident went viral and shocked America. Not just because of its brutality, but because of the question at its heart: was he killed because he was black?\n\nIn search of an answer to that question, journalist Mobeen Azhar tries to get inside the mind of the killer Russell ‘The Muscle’ Courtier, a member of the notorious white supremacist gang European Kindred. Less a whodunnit than a whydunnit, Mobeen’s journey takes him into a secret world of white supremacists, which provides a virulent back-drop to the trial. And getting to know more about the victim Larnell Bruce as the case unfolds, it soon becomes anything but black and white. \n\nIn his debut for BBC Two, British Muslim Mobeen presents a two-part series which unpicks events from every angle. He meets outwardly anti-black extremists, racist neo-nazi skinheads and murderers, uncovering a dark underbelly to the supposedly hipster, liberal city of Portland.\n\nAs it turns out, despite its progressive reputation, the state of Oregon was originally created as a white-only ethno-state, which by the 1920s had more Ku Klux Klan members per head than anywhere else. It is a conflicted history with present-day incarnations. In the run-up to the trial there is a spate of swastikas daubed on public buildings and a truck turned into a mobile advert for Nazi beliefs. In response, billboards spring up to alert the public to the existence of 21 white supremacist groups in Oregon. And most dramatically, anti-fascist groups take to the streets and engage in very public mass brawls with alt-right activists. \n\nIn this cauldron of hate, Larnell Bruce’s death becomes part of a very public battle, which is about decades of racial tension rather than what happened to one young black man. Mobeen attends the trial on a daily basis, listening to evidence, such as the European Kindred cap that was found at the scene, the gang tattoo on Courtier’s leg, and crucial testimony from eye-witnesses. \n\nWith privileged access, Mobeen meets with some of the expert witnesses from court outside of the trial. At every twist and turn he pursues his own investigations, getting to know the families of the defendant and the victim. He visits the crime scene with the lead detective. And critically, he meets with members of the European Kindred gang, that is accused of spawning the white hatred in the first place.\n\nAll roads in the investigation eventually lead into the racially-segregated American prison system, which gave birth to European Kindred. In the tradition of large Californian gangs such as Aryan Brotherhood, Courtier’s gang controls the white side of the prison yard. Going behind bars to confront the racist gangs for himself, Mobeen admits that ‘everything I am: a brown-skinned Muslim journalist – is everything they hate…’\n\nSome court cases are important for the legal precedent they set, others for the political reverberations they send out. The case of Russell Courtier is both: a jury is asked to decide, based on circumstantial evidence, how racist were his thoughts as he put his foot on the pedal, while the whole of America – where the scars of racial injustice still run deep – watches and waits for the verdict.",

"large": "Ten aspiring interior designers on the cusp of turning professional are taking part in the biggest design challenge of their lives. Arriving at a design studio in east London, they nervously meet each other for the first time, before being welcomed by series presenter Fearne Cotton.  \n\nAwaiting for them in her design studio is former editor-in-chief of ELLE Decoration magazine, Michelle Ogundehin. Highly regarded in the design industry, Michelle is a tough judge and someone all the designers look up to, and they are keen to impress her with their skills. Competing to win the ultimate prize, a commercial contract to design a bar at one of London’s top hotels, this is a life changing opportunity for these ten designers.\n\nEach week, the designers are set a different commercial design challenge by Michelle, who then scrutinizes their designs alongside some big-name industry guest judges. Episode one sees Michelle joined by internationally renowned fashion designer turned interiors specialist Matthew Williamson. Lover of bright colours and bold patterns, Matthew offers his own unique take on what makes great design.\n\nSometimes working in teams and sometimes as individuals, every week series judge Michelle ultimately decides what makes a winning design, but also passes judgement on the weakest designs. Alongside the guest judge, she eliminates one designer each week, setting back their hopes and dreams of making a name for themselves in the fiercely competitive design world. \n\nFor their first big commercial challenge, the designers must redesign two show homes. Working in two teams of five, the designers are each given a different room to design within their show home, but they must work together to deliver a cohesive show home that impresses the judges and is accessible to prospective buyers.\n\nWith two days to transform these bland show homes, the designers set off in their teams to Northumberland, location for the first challenge. With lots of contrasting design styles between them, it doesn’t take long for the stronger personalities to make themselves and their design styles known. Compromise comes more easily to some than others, as the teams have to try and work together to adjust their designs to suit the cohesive show home brief.\n\nOne team is definitely out to impress and put their own stamp on their rooms, with some brave and bright colours on the walls, and some bold and daring design statements. The other team decides to play it safer, but not everyone on that team wants to compromise, and for one designer sticking to their guns looks like a risky move.\n\nWith such a short time to turn the show homes around, the designers have a steep learning curve when it comes to teamwork, time management and trying to deliver the perfect designs. Will they learn to compromise so they get the show homes finished on time, and more importantly will their room designs be wow enough to impress the scrutiny of the judges?\n\nJudging the show homes, Michelle and Matthew give an honest and tough critique, as they have to decide which team has answered the brief and delivered a cohesive show home, and which team has gone too far off piste.   \n\nChallenge over, the teams return to Michelle’s design studio to hear the verdict from Fearne. There is relief and celebrations for one team, but for the losers, three designers have to face the judges and justify their design decisions. With the first elimination taking place, by the end of the episode just nine designers remain to face the next tough design challenge.",

Then there’s the British vampire Laszlo – a bit of a rogue and a dandy and a fop, he might say. He’s a lover of mischief and a great soiree, but not as much as he loves seeing Nandor fail miserably in every attempt. And then there’s Nadja: the seductress, the temptress, the vampiric Bonnie to Laszlo’s Clyde. Her wisdom and provocative tales from times past allow us insight into the many ups and downs of living an immortal life.\n\nAlso cohabiting in the vampire household is Guillermo, Nandor’s familiar aka servant/protector during the daylight hours, who wants nothing more than to be made a real vampire just like his master. Also lurking about is Colin Robinson, an energy vampire and day-walker of sorts – he feasts on humans but not on their blood. A frequent visitor is Nadja’s new friend Jenna, a student at a nearby community college. She loves LARPing, boys and art history, and for some reason has been rather confused lately as to why it is she so ravenously craves the flesh of the living.\n\nAfter an unexpected visit from their dark lord and leader, Baron Afanas, the vampires are reminded of what they were initially tasked with upon their arrival in Staten Island over 100 years ago – total and complete domination of the New World. But what exactly is the best way to go about achieving said domination? Our camera crew follows along as the vampires set out to answer this query.",

"large": "In this major landmark series, Professor Brian Cox tells the extraordinary life story of our solar system. For four and a half billion years each of the planets has been on an incredible journey, filled with astonishing spectacle and great drama. Using the data from our very latest explorations of the solar system combined with groundbreaking CGI this series reveals the unimaginable beauty and grandeur of eight planets whose stories we are only just beginning to understand.\n\nThe first episode traces the development of the four rocky worlds closest to the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Born together, they battled the unbelievable violence of the early solar system to become stable planets. For a while each had a moment of hope when they enjoyed almost earth-like conditions. Yet today Mercury is a scorched barren world. Venus is a runaway greenhouse world with a scorching atmosphere and Mars is a frozen desert. Only on Earth do oceans – and life – persist.\n\nWhy has Earth thrived whilst the others have faded away? The most advanced space missions ever mounted allow us to reveal the moments when the fate of each world turned. Mercury was flung across the solar system in a collision of unimaginable ferocity. A young Venus resplendent with oceans was locked in a battle with the sun. And an early wet Mars was robbed of the material it would need to survive.\n\nOnly Earth found itself far enough away from the sun for life to hold on. But it can’t last forever. Billions of years from now our world will follow the fate of its sister planets as the sun expands to become a red giant. But as it does other oases may awaken on the faraway moons of the gas giants - like Saturn’s moon Titan. In the far future, it too may enjoy its moment in the sun.",

A huge clock designed by a modern British artist will be installed outside Tate Modern on the banks of the Thames in a ceremony performed by both Seb Coe and Boris Johnson and will count down towards the start of the Olympic Games. The only problem is that the clock has a potentially disastrous design flaw which no-one seems to have noticed until it is too late. \n\nMeanwhile the process of deciding which public figures should be approached to carry the Olympic Torch on its journey around Britain has begun.",
