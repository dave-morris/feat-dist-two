      "large": "Last year, as London’s murder rate and youth violence hit the headlines, some parts of the capital were thrust into the spotlight. One of those areas was a corner of north London around Tottenham and Wood Green, where last spring three young people were murdered in consecutive months. But what about the young people who don’t make the news? This timely two-part series goes beyond the headlines to find out what life is really like growing up in an area which is as famous for its music industry icons as it is for the London riots or Premier League football. \n\nWhile the violence is real for some, it’s certainly not what defines enigmatic 21-year-old King. The son of first-generation immigrants, he was born and raised in Tottenham. The headlines around him depict a place in crisis, where youth violence has supposedly become the new norm. But the challenges he faces are very different. King is mainly thinking about love - and his dreams – but he’s also negotiating complicated cultural differences with his family. In the short term he needs to find somewhere to live and some way to become financially independent. \n\nAround King’s streets, we meet the neighbourhood’s resident performance poet, Tazzz P, who is saving herself with words and helping to heal a community which has been grieving the deaths of some of its young people. Further down the road is 16-year-old Kaymari, who is about to sit his GCSEs. He feels at risk every time he goes out – not so much from his peers, but because he’s regularly stopped and searched by the police. His mum fears this might derail the life she has carefully helped him to build.\n\n21-year-old youth pastor Onyeka turned his back on his former life and is now trying to pass the lessons he’s learnt on to the young people he meets on the streets - but can he make the difference he feels is needed?\n\nAnd at the local youth centre, there is a fearless 12-year-old vegan who feels that the recent epidemic of youth violence is a larger symptom of society’s lack of compassion. So in unorthodox ways she’s trying to change people from the inside out, by leading a group of vegan activists. \n\nAll this is typical of a day in this corner of north London.",

In a chilling video Rodger said he was angry that he was still a virgin and in his words wanted to show himself as 'the true alpha male' by punishing women for not being attracted to him.\n \nThe legacy of Rodger's assault catapulted online incels into wider consciousness. Incels - short for 'involuntary celibates' - are a global community of sexually frustrated young men, who have found support amongst one another on the net. Some idolise Rodger, and chillingly, his murder spree seems to have helped inspire at least three further mass killings in North America, that have mainly targeted women.  \n \nAt its extreme, incel ideology spreads violent misogyny, which blames women for depriving men of sex and relationships. Some forums have recorded up to 40,000 members and feature depraved ideas like state-sponsored rape and girlfriends. \n \nFollowing eight months of unprecedented access to incels, this documentary is the deepest exploration yet of this notoriously closed community. \n \nTold primarily through the personal stories of three men who identify as incels, the documentary explores how an online ideology can push young men into very disturbing behaviour. But the film also delves behind the sensationalist media headlines to unearth some of the reasons for incels' existence - many feel alienated and are enduring difficulties, like mental health issues, autism or traumatic upbringing.  \n\nFor some, the online forums are a haven to joke, vent and find support in a world where they are struggling to find an identity and where gender relations are changing dramatically. The question is, where are the lines between this radical misogyny and violence?",

    "synopses": {
      "large": "Stacey Dooley investigates bounty hunters in the USA following bounty hunters as they hunt down fugitives who have skipped bail, bringing them back to face justice. \n\nOn the outskirts of Denver in Colorado, Stacey immerses herself in the world of a group of bounty hunters, led by husband and wife duo Scott and Lydia Gribble. They hunt down fugitives every day, locking up as many as eleven bail dodgers a week. She sees them force their way into properties, interrogate accomplices and taser and handcuff defendants who’ve gone on the run. Stacey sees the lengths the bounty hunters will go to capture a fugitive and get paid.\n\nIn America, defendants who are too poor to bail themselves out of jail rely on bondsmen to loan them their bail money. But when they don’t play by the rules the bondsmen can send bounty hunters to go find them and bring them back to court – so the bondsman doesn’t lose his money. These bounty hunters have sweeping powers and in all states but four (Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky and Oregon), nearly anyone, with very little training, can pick up a gun and hunt down fugitives who have gone on the run.\n\nBounty hunters have been part of the American justice system since the 1800s, a system which uses money to make sure people don’t run away after they’ve been charged with a crime. And if defendants do go on the run, paying bounty hunters to go get them means they won’t get away. It’s a $14 billion private industry that does the job that in the UK falls to the government and police, with bondsmen making money from every defendant who needs their help and bounty hunters making money from every fugitive they capture.\n\nAlongside the bounty hunting profession, Stacey learns how the commercial bail system works in America. Robert Boykin is the owner of Hope Bail Bonds. He pays Scott and the gang to hunt down fugitives who have skipped on the bail he has loaned the defendants, for a price. Robert says he is helping people - getting defendants out of jail who cannot afford bail on their own, while they wait for their trial.\n\nStacey meets and interviews the fugitives who Scott and his team arrest as well as the people around them. She learns that relatives and friends become ‘co-signers’ who play an important role in this system. They sign a contract with the bondsman and are legally bound to help the bounty hunters find the defendant if they go on the run. They also have to pay for the bounty hunters and any other costs.\n\nStacey meets 29-year-old Keri who lives with her husband, grandmother and children. Keri was arrested for assaulting an ex-boyfriend, was bailed out by Hope Bail Bonds but then didn’t go to court. So Scott goes to find her and bring her back to jail. She follows the bounty hunters as they go after 21-year-old Bryce who has missed numerous court dates but now has a job at McDonalds. She sees Scott interrogate 17-year-old Image whose mother is the co-signer for a fugitive on the run. And in a run-down part of the city, Stacey sees the bounty hunters taser an aging meth addict who is hiding out in a drug house.\n\nStacey learns that defendants like these rely on bondsmen like Robert because they don’t have enough money to bail themselves out. And if they fail to play by the rules, she sees that they can soon find themselves in real difficulties, with their debts going up and bounty hunters at their door. The bounty hunters and bondsmen believe this for-profit system is the most efficient way of getting people to face justice. But it seems that the poorest and most vulnerable in society pay the highest price.\n\nAs more Americans than ever before rely on the bail industry, Stacey asks what happens when you put a price on people’s freedom?",

Investigative journalist Ellie Flynn goes undercover to get a closer look at this issue.\n\nHaving seen the staggering amount of 'rent for sex' adverts that appear unchecked online, Ellie heads out to discover for herself just how genuine these ads are. Armed with undercover cameras, she meets landlords who post these ads to find out what they really expect in exchange for rent.\n\nThe landlords she confronts protest that it is a mutually beneficial arrangement. One tells her she can stay in a log cabin he has built in exchange for a 'physical arrangement once a week', stating that it's 'nothing abnormal, nothing strange' and telling her she has to be able to deal with that or\nshe shouldn't be there. Another tells her the arrangement would be every second day. She finds people all over the UK offering accommodation in exchange for sex, one even saying the reason the room has become available is because it belongs to his daughter and she's left to go to university. A prospective landlord also tells her he's taking the human aspect out of it and treating it like a business transaction, while others assure her they're just normal guys who just want to help people.\n\nAll the landlords suggest to Ellie that what they're doing is acceptable, but is this how the person taking up the offer would see it? Can it really be consensual when they are preying on vulnerable young people with nowhere else to go? To find out she tracks down and speaks to young women who have taken up these arrangements and asks them how much consent they felt able to give when the alternative was a life on the streets.\n\nDespite laws that exist to criminalise this practice, Ellie asks why there doesn't seem to be anyone doing anything to prevent it. From police forces to the Ministry of Justice, she uncovers a vacuum of responsibility that currently exists.",

From hard-hitting reality checks to hypnotherapy, from social influencers to sober raves, Hayley will be forced to face up to her boozy past and confront sobriety head on.

So when a teenage girl was sexually assaulted at a pre-season football party in 2012, no one came forward with information. \n\nTrue-crime blogger Alex Goddard set out to uncover the truth, piecing together the details of the crime through cell phone footage and photos that made their way to YouTube, as well as a nearly minute-by-minute account of events on social media. In the process, she uncovered both the perpetrators and the entire culture of complicity that enabled them. The ensuing trial, which made national headlines, cut to the very heart of nationwide debates about rape culture.",
